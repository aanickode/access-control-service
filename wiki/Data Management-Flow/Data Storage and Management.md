# Data Storage and Management

## Introduction

The "Data Storage and Management" component within this project is responsible for handling user data and role-based access control. It defines the data models for users and roles, and provides a simple in-memory data store for storing and retrieving this information.

Sources: [src/db.js](), [src/models.js]()

## Data Models

### User Model

The `User` model represents a user entity within the system. It consists of the following fields:

| Field | Type    | Description                    |
|-------|---------|--------------------------------|
| email | string  | The user's email address       |
| role  | string  | The user's assigned role       |

Sources: [src/models.js:1-4]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model defines a role within the system, along with its associated permissions. It has the following fields:

| Field       | Type     | Description                                  |
|-------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| name        | string   | The name of the role                         |
| permissions | string[] | An array of permission strings for the role |

## Data Storage

The project uses an in-memory data store implemented as a JavaScript object called `db`. This data store contains two properties:

1. `users`: An object that maps user email addresses to their respective roles.
2. `roles`: An object that maps role names to their corresponding `Role` objects, which define the permissions associated with each role.

```javascript
const db = {
  users: {
    'admin@internal.company': 'admin',
    'analyst@internal.company': 'analyst',
  },
  roles: roles
};
```

The `roles` object is imported from a JSON configuration file (`roles.json`), which likely defines the available roles and their associated permissions.

## Role-based Access Control (RBAC)

Based on the provided source files, this project appears to implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system. Users are assigned roles, and each role has a set of associated permissions. By checking a user's role, the system can determine which actions or resources the user is authorized to access.

The `roles` object in the `db` data store serves as the central repository for defining and managing roles and their associated permissions. The `users` object maps individual users to their assigned roles, allowing the system to look up a user's permissions based on their role.

While the provided source files do not include implementation details for checking permissions or enforcing access control, the data models and storage mechanisms laid out here form the foundation for an RBAC system within the project.

## Potential Improvements

Based on the limited information available in the provided source files, here are some potential improvements or considerations for the "Data Storage and Management" component:

1. **Persistent Storage**: The current implementation uses an in-memory data store, which means that all user and role data will be lost when the application restarts. Integrating a persistent storage solution, such as a database or file-based storage, would ensure data durability and enable scaling beyond a single application instance.

2. **Data Validation and Sanitization**: The source files do not include any data validation or sanitization mechanisms. Implementing input validation and sanitization for user and role data would enhance security and prevent potential vulnerabilities.

3. **Role Hierarchy and Inheritance**: The current role model does not support role hierarchies or inheritance. Adding support for role hierarchies and permission inheritance could simplify role management and provide more granular access control.

4. **User Authentication and Authorization**: While the source files define user and role data models, they do not include any mechanisms for user authentication or authorization based on roles and permissions. Implementing these features would be necessary for a complete access control system.

5. **Separation of Concerns**: The `db.js` file currently combines data storage and data modeling responsibilities. Separating these concerns into distinct modules or components could improve code organization and maintainability.

6. **Documentation and Testing**: Comprehensive documentation and test coverage for the data storage and access control components would enhance code quality, maintainability, and ensure correct behavior as the project evolves.
