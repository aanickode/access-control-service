# Data Storage and Management

## Introduction

The "Data Storage and Management" component within this project is responsible for managing user data and role-based access control. It serves as a centralized data store for user accounts and their associated roles, enabling the application to authenticate users and enforce appropriate access permissions based on their assigned roles.

Sources: [src/db.js](), [config/roles.json]()

## Data Model

The project uses a simple in-memory data structure to store user accounts and role definitions. The data model consists of two main components:

1. **Users**: A JavaScript object that maps user email addresses (keys) to their corresponding roles (values).
2. **Roles**: A JSON file containing role definitions, where each role is associated with a set of permissions.

```javascript
const db = {
  users: {
    'admin@internal.company': 'admin',
    'analyst@internal.company': 'analyst',
  },
  roles: roles
};
```

Sources: [src/db.js:3-8]()

### Role Definitions

The `roles.json` file defines the available roles and their corresponding permissions. Each role is represented as a key-value pair, where the key is the role name, and the value is an array of permission strings.

```json
{
  "admin": [
    "read:any",
    "write:any",
    "delete:any"
  ],
  "analyst": [
    "read:any"
  ]
}
```

Sources: [config/roles.json]()

## Data Access

The `db` object serves as the central data store and is imported and used throughout the application. It provides direct access to the user and role data, enabling various components to perform authentication, authorization, and other data-related operations.

```javascript
import db from './db.js';

// Access user data
const userRole = db.users['admin@internal.company']; // 'admin'

// Access role definitions
const adminPermissions = db.roles.admin; // ['read:any', 'write:any', 'delete:any']
```

## Limitations and Future Considerations

The current implementation uses a simple in-memory data structure, which may not be suitable for larger-scale applications or scenarios requiring persistent data storage. Future enhancements could include:

1. **Database Integration**: Migrate the data storage to a more robust and scalable database solution, such as a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase).
2. **User Management**: Implement user registration, authentication, and password management functionality.
3. **Role Management**: Provide an interface for creating, updating, and deleting roles and their associated permissions.
4. **Data Validation and Sanitization**: Implement input validation and data sanitization mechanisms to ensure data integrity and security.
5. **Caching and Performance Optimization**: Explore caching strategies and performance optimizations for frequently accessed data.

## Conclusion

The "Data Storage and Management" component in this project provides a simple and straightforward way to manage user accounts and role-based access control. While the current implementation is suitable for small-scale applications or prototypes, it may require enhancements and integration with more robust data storage solutions for production-ready systems.
