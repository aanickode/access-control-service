# Data Storage and Management

## Introduction

The "Data Storage and Management" component within this project is responsible for managing user data and role-based access control. It defines the data models for users and roles, as well as providing a simple in-memory data store for storing and retrieving this information.

Sources: [src/db.js](), [src/models.js]()

## Data Models

### User Model

The `User` model represents a user entity within the system. It has the following properties:

```javascript
export const User = {
  email: 'string',
  role: 'string'
};
```

- `email` (string): The email address of the user, which serves as a unique identifier.
- `role` (string): The name of the role assigned to the user, which determines their access permissions.

Sources: [src/models.js:1-4]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model defines the structure of a role, which is used to manage access control within the system. It has the following properties:

```javascript
export const Role = {
  name: 'string',
  permissions: ['string']
};
```

- `name` (string): The name of the role, which is a unique identifier.
- `permissions` (array of strings): A list of permissions associated with the role, granting access to specific features or resources.

## Data Store

The project uses a simple in-memory data store implemented in the `db.js` file. The data store consists of two main components:

1. `users` object: A key-value store where the keys are user email addresses, and the values are the corresponding user roles.
2. `roles` object: An object containing pre-defined roles and their associated permissions, imported from a JSON configuration file (`roles.json`).

```javascript
const db = {
  users: {
    'admin@internal.company': 'admin',
    'analyst@internal.company': 'analyst',
  },
  roles: roles
};
```

## Role-based Access Control

The project implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system, where user permissions are determined by the roles assigned to them. The `roles.json` file (not shown) likely defines the available roles and their associated permissions.

To check if a user has a specific permission, the system would need to:

1. Retrieve the user's role from the `users` object in the data store.
2. Look up the permissions associated with that role in the `roles` object.
3. Check if the required permission is present in the role's `permissions` array.

While the current implementation uses a simple in-memory data store, in a production environment, this data would typically be stored in a more robust and persistent storage solution, such as a relational database or a NoSQL database.

## Potential Enhancements

Although the current implementation provides a basic foundation for data storage and management, there are several potential enhancements that could be considered:

- **Persistent Storage**: Implement a more robust and persistent storage solution, such as a relational database or a NoSQL database, to store user and role data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure access to the system and ensure proper access control based on user roles and permissions.
- **User Management**: Implement functionality for creating, updating, and deleting user accounts, as well as assigning and modifying user roles.
- **Role Management**: Implement functionality for creating, updating, and deleting roles, as well as managing the associated permissions.
- **Auditing and Logging**: Implement auditing and logging mechanisms to track user activities and changes to user and role data for security and compliance purposes.
- **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to improve performance when retrieving frequently accessed user and role data.
