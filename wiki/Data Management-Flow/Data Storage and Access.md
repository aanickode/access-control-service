# Data Storage and Access

## Introduction

This section covers the data storage and access mechanisms within the project. It appears to be a simple in-memory data store implementation with predefined user accounts, roles, and permissions. The data models and structures are defined, and the data is stored in a JavaScript object.

Sources: [src/db.js](), [src/models.js]()

## Data Models

The project defines two main data models: `User` and `Role`.

### User Model

The `User` model represents a user account and has the following fields:

| Field | Type     | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| email | `string` | The user's email address, which serves as the unique identifier. |
| role  | `string` | The name of the role assigned to the user, which determines their permissions. |

Source: [src/models.js:1-4]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model defines a set of permissions and has the following fields:

| Field       | Type       | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| name        | `string`   | The name of the role. |
| permissions | `string[]` | An array of permission strings associated with the role. |

Source: [src/models.js:6-9]()

## Data Storage

The project uses an in-memory data store implemented as a JavaScript object called `db`. The `db` object has two properties:

1. `users`: An object that maps user email addresses (keys) to their respective roles (values).
2. `roles`: An object that maps role names (keys) to their respective permissions (values).

```javascript
const db = {
  users: {
    'admin@internal.company': 'admin',
    'analyst@internal.company': 'analyst',
  },
  roles: roles // Imported from '../config/roles.json'
};
```

The `roles` object is imported from a JSON file (`../config/roles.json`), which likely defines the available roles and their associated permissions.

Source: [src/db.js:3-10]()

## Data Access

The project does not provide any explicit data access mechanisms or APIs in the given source files. However, it is likely that the `db` object is imported and used elsewhere in the codebase to perform operations such as:

- Authenticating users by checking if their email exists in the `users` object.
- Retrieving a user's role by looking up their email in the `users` object.
- Fetching the permissions associated with a role by looking up the role name in the `roles` object.
- Potentially modifying or extending the data store (e.g., adding new users, roles, or permissions).

Without additional source files or context, it is difficult to provide more details on the data access patterns or APIs used in the project.

## Limitations and Potential Improvements

The current implementation has the following limitations and potential areas for improvement:

- **In-memory data store**: The data is stored in-memory, which means it will be lost when the application restarts or the server is restarted. A persistent data store (e.g., a database) would be more suitable for production environments.
- **Hardcoded data**: The user accounts and roles are hardcoded in the source files. A more flexible approach would be to allow dynamic management of users, roles, and permissions through an administrative interface or API.
- **Lack of data validation**: The source files do not include any data validation or sanitization mechanisms, which could lead to security vulnerabilities or data inconsistencies.
- **Lack of scalability**: As the number of users and roles grows, the in-memory data store may become inefficient or encounter performance issues.
- **Lack of data access APIs**: The source files do not provide any explicit APIs or mechanisms for accessing or modifying the data store, which may limit the project's extensibility and integration with other components.

To address these limitations, the project could consider implementing a more robust and scalable data storage solution, such as a relational or NoSQL database, and developing a well-defined API or set of functions for managing and accessing the data.
