# Extending and Customizing

## Introduction

This wiki page covers the process of extending and customizing the access control system within the project. The access control system manages user roles and permissions, allowing for fine-grained control over what actions users can perform within the application. By understanding the architecture and components involved, developers can tailor the system to meet specific project requirements.

## Role and Permission Management

The access control system revolves around the concepts of roles and permissions. Roles are predefined sets of permissions, and users are assigned one or more roles based on their responsibilities within the application.

### Role Configuration

Roles and their associated permissions are defined in the `config/roles.json` file. This file contains a JSON object where the keys represent role names, and the values are arrays of permission strings.

```json
{
  "admin": ["view_users", "create_role", "view_permissions"],
  "engineer": ["view_users", "view_permissions"],
  "analyst": ["view_users"]
}
```

Sources: [config/roles.json](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/config/roles.json)

### Data Models

The `src/models.js` file defines the data models for users and roles.

```javascript
export const User = {
  email: 'string',
  role: 'string'
};

export const Role = {
  name: 'string',
  permissions: ['string']
};
```

The `User` model has two properties: `email` (a string representing the user's email address) and `role` (a string representing the user's assigned role).

The `Role` model has two properties: `name` (a string representing the role name) and `permissions` (an array of strings representing the permissions associated with the role).

## Extending Roles and Permissions

To extend the access control system with new roles or permissions, follow these steps:

1. **Add a new role to `config/roles.json`**:
   - Define a new key-value pair in the JSON object, where the key is the role name and the value is an array of permission strings.
   - Example: `"new_role": ["permission1", "permission2"]`

2. **Add new permissions to existing roles in `config/roles.json`**:
   - Locate the role you want to modify in the JSON object.
   - Add new permission strings to the array value associated with that role.

3. **Update the `Role` model in `src/models.js`** (if needed):
   - If you introduced new permissions that require additional properties or constraints, modify the `Role` model accordingly.

By following these steps, you can customize the access control system to meet your project's specific requirements, ensuring that users have the appropriate level of access based on their assigned roles and permissions.

## Customizing User Management

While the provided source files do not contain implementation details for user management, you can extend the system to handle user-related operations such as creating, updating, and deleting users.

Potential extensions could include:

- Implementing APIs or services for user CRUD operations.
- Integrating with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Defining additional user properties or models as needed.
- Implementing role assignment and management functionality.

These extensions would require modifying the codebase and potentially introducing new source files or dependencies.

## Conclusion

The access control system in this project provides a flexible and extensible framework for managing user roles and permissions. By understanding the role configuration, data models, and extension points, developers can tailor the system to meet specific project requirements, ensuring secure and granular access control for users based on their assigned roles and permissions.
