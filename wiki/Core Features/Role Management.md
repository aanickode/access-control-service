# Role Management

## Introduction

The Role Management system is a crucial component of the access control service, responsible for defining and managing user roles and their associated permissions within the application. It provides a structured approach to granting or restricting access to various features and functionalities based on a user's assigned role.

By leveraging roles, the application can efficiently control and enforce access privileges, ensuring that users only have the necessary permissions to perform their designated tasks. This not only enhances security but also promotes better organization and maintainability of the codebase.

## Data Models

### User Model

The `User` model represents an individual user within the system. It consists of the following fields:

| Field | Type    | Description                      |
|-------|---------|----------------------------------|
| email | string  | The user's email address         |
| role  | string  | The name of the role assigned to the user |

Sources: [src/models.js:1-4]()

### Role Model

The `Role` model defines a role and its associated permissions. It has the following structure:

| Field       | Type     | Description                       |
|-------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| name        | string   | The name of the role              |
| permissions | string[] | An array of permission identifiers granted to the role |

Sources: [src/models.js:6-9]()

## Role Definitions

The application defines three predefined roles: `admin`, `engineer`, and `analyst`. Each role is associated with a set of permissions that govern the actions and resources a user with that role can access.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Role "1" *-- "0..*" Permission
    class Role {
        +name: string
        +permissions: string[]
    }
    class Permission {
        +identifier: string
    }
```

Sources: [config/roles.json](), [src/models.js:6-9]()

### Role Permissions

The following table outlines the permissions granted to each predefined role:

| Role     | Permissions                                      |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| admin    | view_users, create_role, view_permissions       |
| engineer | view_users, view_permissions                     |
| analyst  | view_users                                       |

## Role Management Flow

The Role Management system likely follows a flow similar to the one depicted in the sequence diagram below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant RoleManager
    participant RoleRepository
    participant UserRepository

    Client->>RoleManager: Request user roles
    RoleManager->>RoleRepository: Retrieve roles
    RoleRepository-->>RoleManager: Return roles
    RoleManager-->>Client: Return roles

    Client->>RoleManager: Request user permissions
    RoleManager->>RoleRepository: Retrieve role permissions
    RoleRepository-->>RoleManager: Return role permissions
    RoleManager-->>Client: Return user permissions

    Client->>RoleManager: Assign role to user
    RoleManager->>UserRepository: Update user role
    UserRepository-->>RoleManager: Confirm role update
    RoleManager-->>Client: Confirm role assignment

    Note over Client, RoleManager: The Role Management system likely interacts with a Role Repository to retrieve role definitions and permissions, and a User Repository to manage user role assignments.
```

## Conclusion

The Role Management system plays a pivotal role in the access control service by defining and managing user roles and their associated permissions. It provides a structured approach to granting or restricting access to various features and functionalities based on a user's assigned role, enhancing security and promoting better organization and maintainability of the codebase.
