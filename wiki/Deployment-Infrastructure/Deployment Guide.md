# Deployment Guide

## Introduction

The deployment guide covers the configuration and setup required to run the application server. Based on the provided source file, the application appears to be a web service or API that listens on a configurable port. This guide will explain how to set the server port and any other relevant deployment details found in the source code.

## Server Configuration

### Port Configuration

The server port is configured using the `PORT` environment variable. This can be set in a `.env` file or directly in the environment where the application is running.

```
PORT=8080
```

The `.env.example` file shows that the default port is `8080`. However, this value can be modified as needed during deployment.

## Deployment Process

Based on the single provided source file, there are no specific details on the deployment process itself. However, it's common for web applications and services to be deployed using various methods, such as:

- Building and running the application directly on a server or virtual machine
- Containerizing the application using Docker or similar technologies
- Deploying to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Service)
- Using a process manager or orchestration tool (e.g., PM2, Kubernetes)

The deployment method may vary depending on the project's requirements, infrastructure, and the presence of additional configuration or deployment scripts not included in the provided source file.

## Conclusion

While the provided source file is limited, it highlights the importance of configuring the server port during deployment. Setting the `PORT` environment variable is a common practice for web applications and services, allowing flexibility in choosing the desired port or adhering to specific requirements of the deployment environment.
