# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project appears to be related to a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing user roles within an access control system. The `cli/manage.js` file provides a simple script that allows assigning roles to user email addresses, which are likely stored in a database or data store. This introduction is based on the limited information available in the provided source files.

## Command-Line Interface

The `cli/manage.js` file contains a Node.js script that serves as a CLI for managing user roles. It accepts command-line arguments and performs the corresponding action based on the provided input.

### Role Assignment

The script supports a single command, `assign-role`, which assigns a specified role to a given user email address.

```javascript
const [,, command, email, role] = process.argv;

if (command === 'assign-role' && email && role) {
  db.users[email] = role;
  console.log(`Assigned role '${role}' to user '${email}'`);
} else {
  console.log('Usage: node manage.js assign-role <email> <role>');
}
```

The script expects three arguments:

1. `command`: The action to perform, which should be `assign-role`.
2. `email`: The email address of the user to assign the role to.
3. `role`: The role to be assigned to the user.

If the provided arguments are valid, the script assigns the specified role to the user's email address in the `db.users` object, which is likely a data store or database. It then logs a success message to the console.

If the arguments are invalid or missing, the script prints a usage message explaining the expected format.

## Data Store

The `cli/manage.js` file imports a `db` module, which is likely a database or data store for managing user information and roles.

```javascript
import db from '../src/db.js';
```

The `db` module is used to access and modify the `users` object, which seems to be a key-value store where the keys are user email addresses, and the values are their assigned roles.

```javascript
db.users[email] = role;
```

Unfortunately, without access to the `db.js` file or additional context, it's difficult to provide more details about the data store's implementation, structure, or potential additional functionality.

## Deployment and Infrastructure Summary

Based on the limited information available in the provided source files, the "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project appears to be focused on a simple command-line interface for managing user roles within an access control system. The CLI script allows assigning roles to user email addresses, which are likely stored in a data store or database.

However, without additional context or source files, it's challenging to provide a more comprehensive overview of the deployment and infrastructure details, such as the hosting environment, build processes, containerization, or infrastructure-as-code configurations.
