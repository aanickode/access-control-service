# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project revolves around the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. The service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it relies on environment variables for configuring the server port.

Sources: [.env.example](), [package.json]()

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to configure various settings. The `.env.example` file provides a template for the required environment variables.

```
PORT=8080
```

This variable specifies the port on which the server should listen for incoming requests. The default value is set to `8080`.

## Application Dependencies

The project's dependencies are managed using the Node.js package manager (npm) and are defined in the `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

The application relies on the following key dependencies:

- **dotenv**: This package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into the `process.env` object.
- **express**: This is the core web application framework used to build the Access Control Service.

## Application Startup

The application's startup process is defined in the `package.json` file under the `scripts` section:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

To start the application, the `npm start` command can be used, which will execute the `node src/index.js` command. This suggests that the main entry point of the application is located in the `src/index.js` file (not provided in the given source files).

## Deployment

Based on the provided source files, there are no explicit details about the deployment process or infrastructure for this application. However, some potential deployment strategies for a Node.js application like this could include:

- Running the application directly on a server or virtual machine
- Containerizing the application using Docker
- Deploying to a cloud platform like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Heroku
- Setting up a reverse proxy server (e.g., Nginx) to handle incoming requests and forward them to the Node.js application

The specific deployment approach would depend on the project's requirements, infrastructure, and operational practices, which are not evident from the provided source files.

## Summary

In summary, the "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on configuring the application's environment variables, managing dependencies, and defining the startup process. The provided source files do not contain explicit details about the deployment infrastructure or strategies. However, common practices for deploying Node.js applications could involve running the application directly on a server, containerizing it, or leveraging cloud platforms or reverse proxy servers.
