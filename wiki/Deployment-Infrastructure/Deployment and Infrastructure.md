# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The Access Control Service is a Node.js application that provides functionality related to access control and authorization within a larger system or project. This wiki page focuses on the deployment and infrastructure aspects of the service, covering how it is set up, configured, and run in different environments.

Sources: [README.md](), [package.json]()

## Application Setup

### Dependencies

The Access Control Service relies on the following dependencies, which are specified in the `package.json` file:

- `dotenv`: This module is used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file during the application's runtime.
- `express`: Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, which is likely used for handling HTTP requests and responses, defining routes, and other web-related functionality.

Sources: [package.json:8-11]()

### Starting the Application

The application can be started by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command executes the `start` script defined in the `package.json` file, which runs `node src/index.js`. This suggests that the main entry point of the application is located in the `src/index.js` file.

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The Access Control Service appears to use environment variables for configuration purposes, as indicated by the `dotenv` dependency. Environment variables are typically used to store sensitive information (such as API keys, database credentials, or other configuration settings) separately from the codebase, allowing for easier management and deployment across different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

While the specific environment variables used by the service are not provided in the given source files, it is a common practice to store them in a `.env` file in the project root directory. This file is typically excluded from version control for security reasons.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

Based on the provided source files, there is no specific information about the deployment infrastructure or process for the Access Control Service. However, as a Node.js application, it can be deployed in various ways, such as:

- Running the application directly on a server or virtual machine
- Containerizing the application using Docker or similar container technologies
- Deploying to a cloud platform like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, or Heroku
- Using a process manager like PM2 or systemd for production deployments

The choice of deployment infrastructure and process would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the project, as well as the organization's practices and policies.

## Conclusion

This wiki page covered the deployment and infrastructure aspects of the Access Control Service, including its dependencies, application setup, configuration using environment variables, and potential deployment options. However, due to the limited information provided in the source files, some details about the actual deployment process and infrastructure were not available.
