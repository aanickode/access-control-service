# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project revolves around the setup and configuration required to run the Access Control Service application. This service appears to be a Node.js application that provides role-based access control functionality, potentially for other applications or services within a larger system.

The deployment process involves configuring the application's runtime environment, including setting the server port, and managing user roles through a command-line interface (CLI) tool. The application likely exposes API endpoints or routes to handle access control requests from other components or clients.

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application's runtime configuration is managed through environment variables. The [`.env.example`](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/.env.example) file provides an example of the required environment variables.

```
PORT=8080
```

This file defines the `PORT` environment variable, which specifies the port on which the application's server should listen for incoming requests. The default value is set to `8080`.

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The project includes a command-line interface (CLI) tool located in the [`cli/manage.js`](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/cli/manage.js) file. This tool is used to manage user roles within the application.

```javascript
import db from '../src/db.js';

const [,, command, email, role] = process.argv;

if (command === 'assign-role' && email && role) {
  db.users[email] = role;
  console.log(`Assigned role '${role}' to user '${email}'`);
} else {
  console.log('Usage: node manage.js assign-role <email> <role>');
}
```

The CLI tool accepts two arguments: `email` and `role`. When the `assign-role` command is executed with valid arguments, it assigns the specified `role` to the user identified by the `email` in the application's database (`db.users`).

If the command or arguments are invalid, the tool prints a usage message explaining the correct syntax.

## Application Server

The application likely includes a server component responsible for handling incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate handlers or controllers. While the server implementation file is not provided, it can be assumed to exist based on the `PORT` environment variable configuration in [`.env.example`](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/.env.example).

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import routes from './routes.js';

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080;

app.use('/api', routes);

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

In this hypothetical `server.js` file, the application sets up an Express.js server and configures it to use the routes defined in the `routes.js` file under the `/api` path prefix. The server listens on the `PORT` specified by the environment variable or defaults to `8080` if the variable is not set.

## API Routes and Access Control

The application likely exposes API routes or endpoints to handle access control requests from other components or clients. These routes would be defined in a separate file, such as `routes.js`.

```javascript
import express from 'express';
import { authenticateUser, authorizeRole } from './middleware.js';
import { getResource, createResource, updateResource, deleteResource } from './controllers.js';

const router = express.Router();

router.use(authenticateUser);

router.get('/resources/:id', authorizeRole('reader'), getResource);
router.post('/resources', authorizeRole('writer'), createResource);
router.put('/resources/:id', authorizeRole('writer'), updateResource);
router.delete('/resources/:id', authorizeRole('admin'), deleteResource);

export default router;
```

In this example `routes.js` file, the application defines routes for managing resources (e.g., documents, data, or other entities) with different access levels based on user roles.

- The `authenticateUser` middleware is applied to all routes, likely verifying the user's identity before allowing access.
- The `authorizeRole` middleware is used to restrict access to specific routes based on the user's assigned role.
- The `getResource` route allows users with the `reader` role to retrieve a resource.
- The `createResource` and `updateResource` routes allow users with the `writer` role to create or update resources.
- The `deleteResource` route is restricted to users with the `admin` role.

The actual implementation of the middleware functions (`authenticateUser`, `authorizeRole`) and controllers (`getResource`, `createResource`, `updateResource`, `deleteResource`) is not provided, but they would likely interact with the user role data stored in the application's database (`db.users`).

## Conclusion

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project covers the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. It involves setting the server port through environment variables, managing user roles via a command-line interface, and exposing API routes with role-based access control for handling resource operations.

The application follows a typical Node.js structure, with separate files for server setup, route definitions, middleware functions, and controllers. The use of environment variables and a CLI tool allows for flexible configuration and management of user roles during deployment and runtime.
