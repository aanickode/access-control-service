# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" section covers the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. This service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it relies on environment variables for configuration. The deployment process involves setting up the necessary dependencies and running the application on a specified port.
Sources: [package.json](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/package.json), [.env.example](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/.env.example)

## Environment Configuration

The application uses the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file. The `.env.example` file serves as a template for the required environment variables.

```
PORT=8080
```

This configuration specifies the port on which the application will run. By default, it is set to `8080`.

## Application Dependencies

The application's dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file, which is used by the Node.js package manager (npm) to install and manage the required packages.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

The two main dependencies are:

1. `dotenv`: Used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
2. `express`: The web application framework used for building the Access Control Service.

## Application Startup

The `package.json` file also defines a `start` script that runs the application's entry point (`src/index.js`).

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

To start the application, you can run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This command will execute the `node src/index.js` command, which should start the Express.js server and listen on the configured port.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process for the Access Control Service involves the following steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and configure the desired port.
3. Start the application using the `npm start` command.

After following these steps, the Access Control Service should be running and accessible on the configured port (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).

Note that this deployment process is suitable for local development or basic production environments. For more complex deployment scenarios, additional steps may be required, such as configuring a web server, setting up a reverse proxy, or using a process manager like PM2.
