# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" section covers the aspects related to deploying and running the application in different environments. Based on the provided source files, this project appears to be a server-side application, potentially a web service or API. The deployment process involves configuring the application's runtime environment, including setting the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests.

Sources: [README.md](), [.env.example]()

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application's runtime configuration is managed through environment variables. The `.env.example` file serves as a template for defining the required environment variables.

## Deployment Process

Based on the limited information provided in the source files, the deployment process for this application is not explicitly described. However, it is common for server-side applications to be deployed on various platforms, such as cloud services (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), containerization environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), or traditional server infrastructures.

The deployment process typically involves the following steps:

1. Building the application artifacts (e.g., executable binaries, Docker images)
2. Configuring the runtime environment (e.g., setting environment variables, configuring infrastructure resources)
3. Deploying the application artifacts to the target environment
4. Starting the application server

Without additional information in the provided source files, it is difficult to provide more specific details about the deployment process for this particular application.

## Summary

In summary, the "Deployment and Infrastructure" section covers the configuration of the application's runtime environment through environment variables, specifically the `PORT` variable for specifying the server's listening port. The deployment process itself is not explicitly described in the provided source files, but it likely follows common practices for server-side applications, involving building artifacts, configuring the environment, deploying to the target infrastructure, and starting the server.
