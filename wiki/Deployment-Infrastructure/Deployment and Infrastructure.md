# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project revolves around the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. The service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it is designed to be deployed as a standalone server application.
Sources: [package.json]()

## Application Server

The Access Control Service is a server-side application that listens for incoming requests on a specified port. The port number is defined in the `.env.example` file, which serves as a template for the actual environment configuration file (`.env`).

```env
PORT=8080
```
Sources: [.env.example:1]()

This configuration allows the application to be deployed on different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) by setting the appropriate port number in the `.env` file.

## Application Dependencies

The project relies on two main dependencies, which are listed in the `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```
Sources: [package.json:8-10]()

1. **dotenv**: This package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into the `process.env` object, which can be accessed throughout the application.
2. **express**: Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, which provides a robust set of features for building web servers and APIs.

These dependencies are installed and managed using the Node.js package manager (npm).

## Application Entry Point

The `package.json` file also specifies the entry point for the application:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```
Sources: [package.json:5-7]()

The `start` script runs the `index.js` file located in the `src` directory, which is likely the main entry point for the Access Control Service application.

## Deployment Process

Based on the provided source files, the deployment process for the Access Control Service involves the following steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the desired `PORT` value.
3. Build or compile the application if necessary (not specified in the provided files).
4. Start the application by running `npm start` or `node src/index.js`.

The application will then start listening for incoming requests on the specified port.

## Infrastructure Requirements

While the provided source files do not explicitly mention infrastructure requirements, it can be inferred that the Access Control Service is designed to run on a server or hosting environment that supports Node.js applications. Depending on the scale and requirements of the project, the infrastructure could range from a single server to a more complex setup involving load balancers, clusters, or containerization (e.g., Docker).

## Conclusion

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on configuring the application server, managing dependencies, and setting up the environment for running the Access Control Service. The provided source files outline the basic configuration and entry point for the application, but additional details regarding the application logic, infrastructure setup, and deployment strategies are not covered.
