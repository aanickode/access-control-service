# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project revolves around setting up and configuring the runtime environment for the Access Control Service application. Based on the provided source files, this service appears to be a Node.js application built using the Express.js framework.

The deployment process involves configuring the application's runtime environment variables and starting the application server. While the source files do not provide explicit details about the deployment infrastructure (e.g., cloud platforms, containerization, etc.), they offer insights into the local development setup and application initialization.

Sources: [package.json](), [.env.example]()

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application relies on environment variables for configuration. The [.env.example]() file serves as a template for setting these variables during the deployment process.

```
PORT=8080
```

This file defines a single environment variable, `PORT`, which specifies the port number on which the application server should listen for incoming requests. The example value provided is `8080`, but this can be modified during deployment to suit the target environment's requirements.

## Application Startup

The application's entry point is defined in the `package.json` file, which is a standard configuration file for Node.js projects.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/index.js"
  }
}
```

The `start` script in the `scripts` section specifies the command to run the application. In this case, it executes the `index.js` file located in the `src` directory using the `node` command.

### Dependencies

The `package.json` file also lists the application's dependencies, which are required for the application to run correctly.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

The listed dependencies are:

- `dotenv`: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into the `process.env` object.
- `express`: A popular web application framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.

These dependencies are automatically installed when running `npm install` in the project directory.

## Deployment Process

While the provided source files do not explicitly outline the deployment process, a typical deployment workflow for a Node.js application like this might involve the following steps:

1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure the target deployment environment (e.g., server, container, cloud platform) has Node.js and the required dependencies installed.
2. **Configuration**: Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and set the appropriate values for the environment variables, such as the desired `PORT`.
3. **Dependency Installation**: Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies listed in `package.json`.
4. **Application Start**: Execute the `start` script defined in `package.json` using `npm run start` or `node src/index.js` to start the application server.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the application's health and performance in the deployed environment.

It's important to note that the provided source files do not cover advanced deployment topics such as containerization, orchestration, scaling, load balancing, or continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. These aspects may require additional configuration and tooling specific to the chosen deployment infrastructure.

## Summary

In summary, the "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on configuring the runtime environment for the Access Control Service application and starting the application server. The provided source files outline the application's entry point, dependencies, and the use of environment variables for configuration. While the deployment process itself is not explicitly defined, the files provide insights into the local development setup and application initialization, which can serve as a foundation for deploying the application to various target environments.
