# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of the Access Control Service project encompasses the configuration and setup required to run the application in a production or development environment. Based on the provided source files, this service appears to be a Node.js Express application that can be deployed as a standalone server.

Sources: [package.json](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/package.json), [.env.example](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/.env.example)

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application utilizes environment variables for configuration purposes. The `.env.example` file provides a template for the required environment variables.

```
PORT=8080
```

This variable specifies the port on which the application server will listen for incoming requests.

Sources: [.env.example](https://github.com/aanickode/access-control-service/blob/main/.env.example)

## Application Dependencies

The project relies on the following third-party dependencies, which are listed in the `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

- **dotenv**: This package is used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file into the Node.js process.
- **express**: Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and handling HTTP requests.

## Application Entry Point

The `package.json` file specifies the entry point for the application:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```

This indicates that the application's main entry point is located in the `src/index.js` file, which is likely where the Express server is configured and started.

## Deployment Process

Based on the provided information, the deployment process for the Access Control Service would typically involve the following steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` template and set the appropriate values for the environment variables, such as the desired port number.
3. **Start the Application**: Run `npm start` to start the application, which will execute the `node src/index.js` command and launch the Express server.
4. **Deploy to Server**: Deploy the entire project directory, including the `node_modules` folder and the `.env` file, to the target server or hosting environment.
5. **Start the Application on the Server**: On the server, navigate to the project directory and run `npm start` to start the application.

It's important to note that the provided source files do not include details about more advanced deployment strategies, such as containerization (e.g., Docker), orchestration (e.g., Kubernetes), or cloud deployment (e.g., AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud). These aspects would require additional configuration files or infrastructure-as-code resources, which are not present in the provided source files.
