# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. The service is built using Node.js and the Express.js framework, and it is designed to be deployed as a standalone server application. This section will cover the necessary steps and components involved in deploying and running the service.

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to configure certain settings. The `.env.example` file provides an example of the environment variables that can be set.

```
PORT=8080
```

This variable specifies the port on which the server should listen for incoming requests. If not set, the application will use a default port.

## Application Dependencies

The project relies on several third-party dependencies, which are listed in the `package.json` file.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

- **dotenv**: This package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into the Node.js process.
- **express**: This is the core web application framework used to build the Access Control Service.

## Application Startup

The `package.json` file also defines a script for starting the application:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```

This script runs the `index.js` file located in the `src` directory, which is likely the entry point of the application.

## Deployment Process

To deploy and run the Access Control Service, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on the target server or deployment environment.
2. Clone the project repository or copy the source code to the target environment.
3. Navigate to the project directory in a terminal or command prompt.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the desired environment variables (e.g., `PORT`).
6. Run `npm start` to start the application.

The application will start listening for incoming requests on the configured port (or the default port if not specified).

## Conclusion

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project covers the necessary configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. It involves setting environment variables, installing dependencies, and running the application using the provided scripts. The deployment process is relatively straightforward and follows standard Node.js application deployment practices.
