# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The provided source file `.env.example` suggests that this project is a server-based application or service that runs on a specific port. The purpose of this file is to define environment variables used for configuration during deployment and runtime. In this case, the only environment variable defined is `PORT`, which specifies the port number on which the application should listen for incoming requests.

## Server Configuration

### Port Configuration

The application's server is configured to listen on a specific port number, as defined by the `PORT` environment variable. The default value provided in the `.env.example` file is `8080`.

```
PORT=8080
```

This configuration allows the application to receive incoming requests on the specified port. During deployment, this environment variable can be overridden with a different port number if desired, allowing flexibility in the deployment environment.

## Deployment and Infrastructure Summary

Based on the provided source file, the deployment and infrastructure aspects of this project appear to be relatively straightforward. The application is designed to run as a server, listening for incoming requests on a configurable port number specified by the `PORT` environment variable. No other deployment or infrastructure details are evident from the provided file.

It's worth noting that the `.env.example` file is typically used as a template for creating a `.env` file, which would contain the actual environment variable values used during runtime. The `.env` file is usually excluded from version control for security reasons, as it may contain sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.
