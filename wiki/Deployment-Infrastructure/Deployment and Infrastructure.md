# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "access-control-service" project is a Node.js application that appears to be responsible for managing access control functionality. This wiki page focuses on the deployment and infrastructure aspects of the project, as evidenced by the provided source files.

Based on the `package.json` file, the project uses the Express.js framework for building web applications and APIs. The `.env.example` file suggests that the application is configured to run on a specific port, which can be customized during deployment.

## Application Deployment

The deployment process for the "access-control-service" project seems straightforward, as indicated by the scripts section in the `package.json` file.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```

To start the application, the `npm start` command can be executed, which will run the `node src/index.js` command. This suggests that the entry point of the application is located in the `src/index.js` file (not provided in the given source files).

## Environment Configuration

The project utilizes the `dotenv` package, which is listed as a dependency in the `package.json` file. This package is commonly used for loading environment variables from a `.env` file during the application's runtime.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

The `.env.example` file provides an example of the environment variables that the application expects. In this case, it includes a `PORT` variable, which is likely used to specify the port on which the application should listen for incoming requests.

```
PORT=8080
```

During deployment, it is recommended to create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file and configure the appropriate values for the environment variables.
