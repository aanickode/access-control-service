# Deployment and Infrastructure

## Introduction

The "Deployment and Infrastructure" aspect of this project focuses on the configuration and setup required to run the Access Control Service application. It covers the application's runtime environment, dependencies, and the process of starting the service. Based on the provided source files, this service appears to be a Node.js application built with Express.js framework.

Sources: [.env.example](), [package.json]()

## Application Configuration

### Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables to configure certain settings. The `.env.example` file provides an example of the environment variables that can be set.

```
PORT=8080
```

This variable specifies the port on which the application should listen for incoming requests. The default value is set to `8080`.

Sources: [.env.example:1]()

## Application Dependencies

The application's dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file, which is a standard file used by Node.js projects to manage dependencies and scripts.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "dotenv": "^16.0.3",
  "express": "^4.18.2"
}
```

The application relies on the following dependencies:

- **dotenv**: A module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **express**: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js.

## Application Startup

The `package.json` file also defines a script for starting the application:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node src/index.js"
}
```

To start the application, you can run the following command:

```
npm run start
```

This command will execute the `node src/index.js` script, which likely sets up and starts the Express.js server.

### Application Entry Point

Based on the `start` script, the entry point of the application appears to be located at `src/index.js`. However, the contents of this file are not provided in the given source files, so further details about the application's initialization and server setup cannot be inferred.

## Deployment

The provided source files do not contain any specific information about deployment strategies or infrastructure setup for this application. However, based on the application being a Node.js Express.js service, it can be deployed to various hosting environments that support Node.js, such as:

- Cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- Containerization platforms (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes)
- Virtual or physical servers

The deployment process would typically involve building or copying the application code, installing dependencies, setting environment variables, and running the `start` script or a similar command to start the server.
