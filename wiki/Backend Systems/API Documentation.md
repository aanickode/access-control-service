# API Documentation

## Introduction

The API Documentation covers the implementation of the RESTful API endpoints for an access control service. This service manages user roles, permissions, and authentication tokens within an application. The API allows authorized clients to retrieve user information, create and view roles and permissions, and generate authentication tokens for users.

Sources: [src/routes.js]()

## API Endpoints

### GET /users

This endpoint retrieves a list of all registered users and their associated roles.

#### Request

```
GET /users
```

#### Response

```json
[
  { "email": "user1@example.com", "role": "admin" },
  { "email": "user2@example.com", "role": "editor" },
  ...
]
```

#### Access Control

This endpoint requires the `view_users` permission.

Sources: [src/routes.js:6-8]()

### POST /roles

This endpoint creates a new role with a specified set of permissions.

#### Request

```
POST /roles
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "editor",
  "permissions": ["edit_content", "publish_content"]
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "role": "editor",
  "permissions": ["edit_content", "publish_content"]
}
```

#### Access Control

This endpoint requires the `create_role` permission.

Sources: [src/routes.js:10-16]()

### GET /permissions

This endpoint retrieves a list of all defined roles and their associated permissions.

#### Request

```
GET /permissions
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "admin": ["view_users", "create_role", "view_permissions"],
  "editor": ["edit_content", "publish_content"],
  ...
}
```

#### Access Control

This endpoint requires the `view_permissions` permission.

Sources: [src/routes.js:18-20]()

### POST /tokens

This endpoint generates an authentication token for a user by associating them with a specific role.

#### Request

```
POST /tokens
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user": "user1@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "user": "user1@example.com",
  "role": "admin"
}
```

#### Access Control

This endpoint does not require any specific permission.

Sources: [src/routes.js:22-28]()

## Data Flow

The API endpoints interact with a central data store (`db.js`) to manage user roles, permissions, and authentication tokens.

```mermaid

    Client --> API[API Endpoints]
    API --> DB[(Database)]
    DB --> API
    API --> Client
```

## Access Control Middleware

The API uses a middleware function `checkPermission` to enforce access control for certain endpoints based on the user's assigned role and permissions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Middleware
    participant DB

    Client->>API: Request
    API->>Middleware: checkPermission
    Middleware->>DB: Retrieve user role
    DB-->>Middleware: User role
    Middleware-->>API: Permit/Deny
    API-->>Client: Response
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:1,6,10,18]()

## Role and Permission Management

The API provides endpoints to create and manage roles and their associated permissions.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Role {
        +name: string
        +permissions: string[]
    }
    
    class PermissionManager {
        +createRole(name, permissions)
        +getPermissions()
    }
    
    PermissionManager --> Role : manages
```

Sources: [src/routes.js:10-16,18-20]()

## User Authentication

The API allows clients to generate authentication tokens for users by associating them with a specific role.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ TOKEN : has
    TOKEN }o--|| ROLE : assigned

    USER {
        email string
    }

    TOKEN {
        user string
        role string
    }

    ROLE {
        name string
        permissions string
    }
```

## Configuration

The API does not expose any configurable options or settings in the provided source files.

## Conclusion

The API Documentation covers the implementation details of the RESTful API endpoints for managing user roles, permissions, and authentication tokens within an access control service. It outlines the available endpoints, their request/response formats, access control requirements, and the underlying data flow and architecture. Developers can use this documentation to integrate with and extend the access control functionality in their applications.
